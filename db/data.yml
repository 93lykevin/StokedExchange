      Like newer 350 V2 models, the adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2 Lundmark sports a subtle summer color with the back heel tab removed. Replacing the SPLY-350 boost stripe that was traditionally found on the original 350s is a transparent stripe that reveals a more cream colored inner. A boost midsole is covered by a light tan rubber outsole that features a pink middle stripe. Adding to the exclusivity of these is the fact this colorway is a North and Latin America exclusive.
      <br><br>The Lundmark Yeezy Boost 350 V2 released on July 11, 2019 at a retail price of $220.

    - adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2 Semi Frozen Yellow
    - The Semi Frozen Yellow adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2 was rumored as early as May
      of 2017-some blogs even claimed they would be mostly glow-in-the-dark-but it
      was when photos of Kanye West wearing them first surfaced on the web later in
      the year that confirmed the release. This colorway steps outside of the comfort
      zone of previous 350 Yeezy sneaker releases, which have remained subtle and
      mostly neutral primary colors and bright accents.  The official colorway of
      the 'Frozen Yellow Yeezys' is actually Semi Frozen Yellow, Raw Steel and Red
      and features both of adidas pinnacle technologies, Boost cushioning and Primeknit
      sock-like upper. The hype for the yellow colored Yeezys was pushed to the roof
      before launch as Kanye West appeared with Kid Cudi and Takashi Murakami as 'Ye
      and Cudi toured the iconic artist's studio on a trip to Tokyo. In addition,
      the rumors throughout the sneaker world suggested the Frozen Yellow Yeezy would
      be an extremely hard to get release. As expected, the Semi Frozen Yellow was
      announced officially on November 13th, 2017 and released in limited quantities
      on November 18th, 2017. Sizes of the adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2 Semi Frozen Yellow
      are available now.

    - adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2 Beluga 2.0
    - The Yeezy Beluga 2.0 takes Kanye West's famous adidas sneakers full circle by
      returning to the colors of the first adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2. While the original
      colorway featured a bright orange (officially Solar Red) stripe across the side,
      the 2017 release of the Yeezy Beluga colorway is much more subtle. This colorway
      utilizes the same Zebra-like stripes as the original but the SPLY-350 branding
      is the only part of the upper with a contrasted color-this time called Bold
      Orange. The Yeezy Beluga 2.0 nickname comes from the similarities to the earlier
      colorway but the official colorway of this adidas Yeezy release is Grey, Bold
      Orange, and Dark Grey. The toned down color combo made it an appealing shoe
      for the masses compared to some previous Yeezy colorways. Despite rumors suggesting
      an October drop, the official release date for the Beluga 2.0 was November 25th,
      2017. Since then it has been one of the most active sneakers on StockX, continually
      selling well above its retail price. You can get the Yeezy Beluga 2.0 on StockX
      now by placing a Bid or choosing to Buy Now.

Printed insoles with graphics of plans and sketches, red branding on the tongue labels and embroidered heel, and white outsoles complete the design. The packaging includes two sets of laces and a set of collaborative pins.These sneakers released in August of 2019 and retailed for $120.

      <br><br>
      This AJ 1 features a similar design to the “UNC Patent” 1s that released in February of 2019, only this time the colorway receives a full leather treatment. This sneaker released in August of 2019 and retails for $160.

    - Jordan 12 Retro Fiba (2019)
    - |-
      Jordan Brand welcomes with 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup with the Air Jordan 12 “FIBA”, now available on StockX. FIBA (Originally known as the Fédération Internationale de Basketball Amateur) is an association of national organizations which governs the sport of basketball worldwide. Every four years, nations that are members of this organization compete for the World Cup. In 2017, Nike partnered with FIBA to become the official sponsor of the organization so it is fitting that Jordan pays tribute with this colorway.
      <br>
      <br>
      This AJ 12 is reminiscent of the existing “Rising Sun” colorway except it differs by displaying red detailing with gold accents. This design features a white leather upper detailed with different symbols from flags. Chinese text on the heel tab and the signature “TWO 3” embroidery on the tongue completes the design. These sneakers released in August of 2019 and retailed for $190.

    - Jordan 4 Retro Cool Grey (2019)
    - |
      Jordan Brand brings back a mid-2000’s classic with the Air Jordan 4 “Cool Grey”, now available on StockX. After originally releasing in 2004, the Cool Grey 4 has not since been retroed until 2019. The “Cool Grey” color garnered attention when it was featured on a pair of Air Jordan 11 Retros in 2001. It seemed only fitting for Jordan to carry this tremendous colorway to a very notable design with the Air Jordan 4.
      <br>
      <br>
      These AJ 4s are very similar to the 2004 release, featuring a cool gey upper, chrome hardware, and a dark charcoal interior. In classic Jordan 4 fashion, a heel tab is present sporting a Jumpman logo. A white midsole, dark charcoal outsole, and yellow detail embroidery on the tongue complete the design. These sneakers released in August of 2019 and retailed for $190.

    - "Jordan Brand pays homage to designer Tinker Hatfield with the Air Jordan 3
      Tinker “Black Cement”, now available on StockX. Ever since Tinker Hatfield stepped
      into Nike headquarters his impact has been felt across the world. This shoe
      is a celebration of not only the first Jordan model that Tinker designed, but
      also the first shoe he designed for Nike which is the Air Max 1. \n<br>\n<br>\nThis
      Jordan 3 is a spin off of the classic “Black Cement” that has been a street
      favorite since its release in 1988. A black suede upper with a familiar elephant
      print mudguard is featured, but instead of the elephant print sporting grey
      tones, it is black. A grey Swoosh overlays the upper, drawing inspiration from
      Tinkers first projects for Nike. A white midsole, grey outsole, and gold hardware
      completes the design. These sneakers released in July of 2019 and retailed for
      $200."

    - Jordan 1 Low SB UNC
    - |-
      Legendary skateboarder and sneakerhead Eric Koston delivers UNC nostalgia with the Nike SB Air Jordan 1 Low “UNC”, now available on StockX. This shoe draws inspiration from a classic Air Jordan 1 High model that originally released in 1985. The original design incorporated University Blue overlays, a color that has been made famous by Jordan’s alma mater, the University of North Carolina. This historic colorway combined with a long history of the skateboard communities love for the Jordan 1 made this a no brainer collaboration.
      <br>
      <br>
      Just like many basketball shoes turned SB, this AJ 1 features improved technology including Nike SB heel Zoom sockliner for skating comfort. This low top sports a white leather upper with dark powder blue overlays and Swoosh. A white midsole, blue outsole, and Nike SB branding on the tongue and insoles completes the design. These sneakers released in August of 2019 and retailed for $110.

    - adidas Yeezy Boost 700 Wave Runner Solid Grey
    - 'A new set of waves are rolling in as the adidas Yeezy Wave Runner 700s get
      ready for their first restock on March 10th, 2018. First releasing in November
      of 2017, the Yeezy Boost 700’s represented what was a significant shift in Kanye’s
      design aesthetic, moving from the minimalistic silhouettes of early Yeezy seasons
      to this chunky runner model. It once again showed how Kanye stays ahead of the
      curve, as chunkier sneakers became more en vogue in 2018. The shoe features
      an upper with grey and black suede overlays, premium leather with blue mesh
      underlays, neon green laces, and its signature chunky midsole with encapsulated
      Boost technology. Translation: these may look bold but are still comfy as hell.
      The Yeezy Wave Runners will stay at the same retail cost of $300 for the upcoming
      restock, but have averaged a sale price well above retail on StockX since their
      initial drop. So if you’re looking to add these to your Yeezy collection, remember
      that fortune favors the bold bidders.'

    - Supreme Jean Paul Gaultier Tee White
    - For their Week 7 drop, Supreme's reached into their luxury rolodex to call out
      a name as shocking as can be. Coming off a several year ready-to-wear hiatus,
      Jean Paul Gaultier's worked with Supreme on a collaborative collection in reference
      to the designer's "F*** Racism" campaign from the early 90's. Released in two
      colors, black and white, the tee from this collection will likely be subject
      to questions and criticism pertaining to it's validity as a proper box logo
      tee. Featuring the box logo over an illustration, the logo rests on the stomach
      and not the chest, mixing up the classic design. Retailing at $54 dollars, the
      collaboration holds far more attainable price points than some of Supreme's
      other luxury collaboration counterparts. The JPG collaboration and this tee
      released on Thursday April 11th, 2019.

    - ASICS Gel-Lyte III Ronnie Fieg "Flamingo"
    - Over a year since his previous GL3 release, Ronnie Fieg brought back his creative
      expertise on one of his favorite ASICS models with the Ronnie Fieg x Asics Gel-Lyte
      III "Flamingo." Released in August of 2014, the Flamingo GLIII was an instant
      standout among his other works. Originally a 1-of-1 sample that he had created
      for himself back in 2009, at first RF was hesitant to release the Flamingo Gel
      Lytes to the world because of their untraditional color palette. Yet, after
      releasing a picture via social media and receiving an overwhelming response
      from the public, Ronnie finally felt as though it was time to add the Flamingo
      GEL Lyte 3 to his already extensive ASICS catalog. Inspired by the ashy color
      of flamingos' feathers, the apron and rear paneling are subtly pink-hued grey.
      The salmon striping through the mid-foot and the 3M hits on the toe box reflect
      the colors that flamingos turn after feasting on salmon. The blue lining on
      the Gel Lyte represents the water in which they prey and was the first time
      Fieg used thin neoprene material on a collaboration. Released alongside a handful
      of Japanese French terry apparel pieces, the Flamingo were priced at $150. After
      instantly selling out both in-store at Kith and online, the Ronnie Fieg x Asics
      Gel-Lyte III "Flamingo" is one of the most coveted shoes in a long line of successful
      Fieg collaborations.

    - ASICS Gel-Lyte III Ronnie Fieg "Leatherbacks"
    - Adorned with a rich, grey suede toe box and nubuck apron, the Ronnie Fieg x
      Asics Gel-Lyte III "Leather back" were released on November 18th, 2011 as part
      of the Kith Manhattan Grand Opening. The Leatherbacks were available in 2 different
      packages, one which retailed for $200, while the other just $130. The first
      package contained the Leather backs GL3, an American-made Kith x ASICS shirt,
      and wooden dog tags inside a laser engraved and numbered wooden box, of which
      only 40 were made. The second package contained only the Leather Back GLIII
      and was available to those who were not able to purchase the special packaging
      in-store and to those who made their purchase online. The Leatherback Gel Lytes
      were a shift in Ronnie's work from using bright color palettes to darker, more
      robust hues. Shadowing the GEL-Lyte IIIs that came before this, the Salmon Toes,
      the Leather Backs were almost the mirror opposite with their dark undertones.
      Using premium leather that was meant to survive the frosty winters in New York,
      RF selected electric blue accents to breakup the darker tones of the mid and
      rear panelling almost like neon lights cutting through the city skyline. Even
      years after their release, the Ronnie Fieg x Asics Gel-Lye III "Leather back"
      is one of the most heralded releases from Kith and is extremely sough-after
      by collectors the world over.

    - ASICS Gel-Lyte III Ronnie Fieg "Mint Leaf"
    - 'Following his 2010 release of the "Cove" GL3, Ronnie again created a piece
      that is almost synonymous with his name: the Ronnie Fieg x Asics Gel-Lyte III
      "Mint Leaf." As a child, RF would visit family in Israel annually, and their
      family would drink fresh mint-infused tea together. Fieg was in-charge of picking
      the mint leaves off the branches from his grandmother''s garden, eventually
      earning himself the nickname "Minty." And although no longer a young boy, those
      experiences from his childhood impacted him enough to inspire the GEL Lyte 3
      "Mint Leaf." Using a vibrant green nubuck as the upper apron and rear panel,
      with a mesh toe and split tongue, the Mint GLIII used his signature monochromatic
      coloring against a light-grey midsole with darker grey accents. Released in
      July of 2011, before RF''s store Kith was opened, the Mint GEL-Lyte 3 proved
      to be Ronnie''s last release at David Z and retailed for $120. In the years
      following their release, the Ronnie Fieg x Asics Gel-Lyte III "Mint Leaf" proved
      to withstand the test of time. So much so, that in 2014 RF did another rendition
      of the colorway set across the ASICS Gel-Lyte V model giving those who had thirsted
      for the shoe for nearly three years an opportunity to add the colorway to their
      collections.'

    - KAWS x Uniqlo Gone Tee (US Sizing) White
    - As early as two months before KAWS x Uniqlo UT's final drop together, news that
      the collaboration was happening seemed to leak. From there, KAWS took to Instagram
      to announce the collaboration officially via several animated posts of BFFs
      and Companions holding up different KAWS x Uniqlo shirts. Shortly after the
      official announcement of the collaboration, KAWS took to Instagram again to
      announce that this would also be the final collaboration between the artist
      and Uniqlo. The result was an unprecedented level of hype which resulted in
      the site crashing and riots in some malls in China. The white Gone Tee features
      a KAWS Companion figure carrying a BFF figure as depicted in his GONE exhibit.
      The artist's signature XXs are embroidered on the sleeve of the shirt as well.
      The KAWS x Uniqlo Flayed Tee dropped on Monday, June 3rd, 2019 and retailed
      for $15 USD.

    - Stussy x Cactus Plant Flea Market USA 2019 Tee White
    - After being previewed several days before the 4th of July, Stussy's collaborative
      capsule with Cactus Plant Flea Market released to an instant sellout on the
      US holiday. Maximalist cobranding is impossible to ignore as more than three
      different Stussy logos can be seen overlapping and in conjunction with several
      CPFM logos. Coinciding with the holiday it was released on, US Independence
      Day, "U.S.A." is also featured on the front of the shirt in large print. The
      Stussy x Cactus Plant Flea Market USA 2019 Tee released on July 4th, 2019 and
      retailed for $45 USD.
