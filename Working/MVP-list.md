StreetXchange, a StockX clone, is an ecommerce website that operates similarly to how a stock market operates. Users can sell items and place bids on other items. A seller(also a user) can place an "asking price" for the item they are selling. When a bid and asking price match, a product is sold. The website also shows historical data on a product similar to how a stock exchange tracks the price of a particular stock.
